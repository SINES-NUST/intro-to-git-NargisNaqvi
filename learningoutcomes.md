Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS), which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what youâ€™ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. With Git i can clone, fork create repositories and branches. i can commit changes and sync them.
